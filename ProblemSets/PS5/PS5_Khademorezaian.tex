\begin{itemize}
    
    \item I scrapped Glassdoor job postings. I looked for the job title, company name and location. I find it interesting to see if the patterns of job posting changes during the lock down. It is useful to know how to scrape js websites but they made this data public last year. I did use \href{https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905}{towardsdatascience}.
    \item I got daily twitter trends in Oklahoma. I used tweepy to handle twitter API. There is nothing specific to it but I usually run it daily since it gives more entry than my homepage.

\end{itemize}
