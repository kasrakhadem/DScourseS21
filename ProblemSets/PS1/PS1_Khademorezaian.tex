\maketitle

I needed to improve my skills in R and learn how to use the resources in OU (super computers) for my future research. I also find the topic interesting and essential for any major. I am very excited for the machine learning part and data visualization.
    
I scraped Glassdoor job postings for about 2 month in summer and I am thinking about using that data for my project. I'm not sure about the details yet but I want to see how the job postings changed in summer and if they follow the unemployment trends published by the bureau of labor statistics.
    
I am looking for a job in academia after graduation.
